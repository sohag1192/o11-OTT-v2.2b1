### 🔑 Key Notes
- This repo is **binary-focused**: it contains the patched executable and a README, but no source code.  
- It’s mainly for **testing and experimentation**, not production deployment.  
- For production readiness, you’ve already been working on **v3 installers** (`v3.1.sh`) with systemd integration, logging, and cleanup.

👉 Since you’re refining **v3** for production, I can help you draft a **branded README for v2.2b1** that matches your newer repos — bilingual (Bangla/English), with clear install steps, service setup, and branding. That way, your older repos look consistent with your professional style. Would you like me to prepare that README draft for `O11-OTT-V2.2b1`?
